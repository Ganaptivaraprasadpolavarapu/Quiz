  {id:88,topic:'Data Structures',question:'Which is best data structure to implement undo functionality?',options:['Queue','Stack','Heap','HashMap'],answer:'B',explain:'Undo is naturally modeled by stack (LIFO): last action undone first.'},
  {id:89,topic:'Algorithms',question:'Which problem class does subset sum belong to?',options:['P (polynomial)','NP-Complete','NL','BPP'],answer:'B',explain:'Subset sum is NP-Complete; it is in NP and believed not solvable in polynomial time in general.'},
  {id:90,topic:'Time Complexity',question:'If f(n)=3n^2+2n+1, which term dominates asymptotically?',options:['3n^2','2n','1','All same'],answer:'A',explain:'Highest-order term (n^2) dominates; constants are ignored in Big-O.'},
  {id:91,topic:'Operating Systems',question:'Which is true about kernel mode vs user mode?',options:['Kernel mode has fewer privileges than user mode','Kernel mode has full hardware access and more privileges','They are same','User mode has direct hardware access'],answer:'B',explain:'Kernel mode runs with full privileges and can perform privileged operations; user mode is restricted.'},
  {id:92,topic:'Computer Networks',question:'Which is true about TCP flow control?',options:['It prevents network congestion globally','It provides sender-side pacing only','It prevents sender from overwhelming receiver using windowing','It encrypts data'],answer:'C',explain:'TCP flow control uses window size to ensure sender does not overflow receiver buffers.'},
  {id:93,topic:'Databases',question:'Which command changes the structure of a table (e.g., add column)?',options:['INSERT','UPDATE','ALTER','MODIFY'],answer:'C',explain:'ALTER TABLE modifies table schema like adding/dropping columns.'},
  {id:94,topic:'Pointers',question:'Which is true for references in C++ (T&)?',options:['They can be reseated to refer to another object','They must be initialized and cannot be changed to refer to another object','They are same as pointers','They can be NULL'],answer:'B',explain:'References must be initialized at creation and cannot be reseated; they cannot be NULL (unless using workaround).'},
  {id:95,topic:'Data Structures',question:'Which data structure ensures O(1) time for push/pop and supports LIFO?',options:['Queue','Stack','Binary Tree','HashMap'],answer:'B',explain:'Stack supports LIFO with O(1) push/pop operations.'},
  {id:96,topic:'Algorithms',question:'Which algorithm is used for topological sorting of a DAG?',options:['Dijkstra','Kahn\'s algorithm or DFS-based','Prim','Bellman-Ford'],answer:'B',explain:'Topological sort can be done via Kahn\'s algorithm (in-degree) or DFS postorder.'},
  {id:97,topic:'Time Complexity',question:'Which of the following is true about Theta notation?',options:['It gives a tight bound (both upper and lower)','It is only lower bound','It is only upper bound','It is approximate and not formal'],answer:'A',explain:'Theta gives tight bound meaning the function grows both at least and at most as indicated asymptotically.'},
  {id:98,topic:'Operating Systems',question:'Which security mechanism isolates processes from each other?',options:['Virtual memory and access controls','Using global variables','Using only one user','Disabling interrupts'],answer:'A',explain:'Virtual memory provides address space isolation and access controls enforce permissions between processes.'},
  {id:99,topic:'Computer Networks',question:'Which protocol provides reliable file transfer over the internet?',options:['FTP over TCP','TFTP over UDP','ICMP','SMTP'],answer:'A',explain:'FTP typically runs over TCP which provides reliability; TFTP uses UDP and is less reliable.'},
  {id:100,topic:'Databases',question:'What is denormalization?',options:['Breaking tables further','Combining tables/adding redundancy to speed reads','Encrypting data','Normalizing again'],answer:'B',explain:'Denormalization intentionally introduces redundancy to reduce joins and improve read performance.'}
